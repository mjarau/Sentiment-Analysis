# Sentiment Analysis

For this project, four machine learning (ML) models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression & Decision Tree) were used to predict sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The best suited ML model was observed to be SVM classifier model. 

## Data
The data used in this prediction was obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews 

The data is an IMDB dataset of 50k moview reviews containing two columns (review and sentiment) that will assist us in identifying the type of a review whether it is positive or negative.
